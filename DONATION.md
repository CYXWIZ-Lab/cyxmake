## Why Support?

Open source projects require significant time and resources:

- **Development** - Writing code, fixing bugs, adding features
- **Maintenance** - Reviewing issues, updating dependencies, security patches
- **Documentation** - Tutorials, guides, API references
- **Community** - Answering questions, reviewing contributions
- **Infrastructure** - CI/CD, hosting, testing across platforms

Your contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference!
